Title: C/C++ Source Code to Trigger Address and Undefined Behaviour Sanitizers

Description: Recent gcc and clang compiler versions provide functionality to
 test for memory violations and other undefined behaviour; this is often 
 referred to as "Address Sanitizer" (or 'ASAN') and "Undefined Behaviour 
 Sanitizer" ('UBSAN'). The Writing R Extension manual describes this in some
 detail in Section 4.3 title "Checking Memory Access".
 .
 This feature has to be enabled in the corresponding binary, eg in R, which
 is somewhat involved as it also required a current compiler toolchain which 
 is not yet widely available, or in the case of Windows, not available at all
 (via the common Rtools mechanism).
 .
 As an alternative, pre-built Docker containers such as the Rocker container
 'r-devel-san' or the multi-purpose container 'r-debug' can be used.
 .
 This package then provides a means of testing the compiler setup as the
 known code failures provides in the sample code here should be detected
 correctly, whereas a default build of R will let the package pass.
 .
 The code samples are based on the examples from the Address Sanitizer
