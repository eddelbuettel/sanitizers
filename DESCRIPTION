Title: C/C++ source code to trigger Address and Undefined Behaviour Sanitizers
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2014-07-29
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: Recent gcc and clang compiler versions provide functionality to
 memory violations and other undefined behaviour; this is often referred to as
 "Address Sanitizer" (or SAN) and "Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer" (UBSAN).
 The Writing R Extension manual describes this in some detail in Section 4.9.
 .
 This feature has to be enabled in the corresponding binary, eg in R, which
 is somewhat involved as it also required a current compiler toolchain which 
 is not yet widely available, or in the case of Windows, not available at all
 (via the common Rtools mechanism).
 .
 As an alternative, the pre-built Docker containers available via the Docker Hub
 at https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/eddelbuettel/docker-debian-r/ can be used
 on Linux, and via boot2docker on Windows and OS X.
 .
 This package then provides a means of testing the compiler setup as the
 known code failures provides in the sample code here should be detected
 correctly, whereas a default build of R will let the package pass.
